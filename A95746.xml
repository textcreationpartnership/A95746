         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, I meane ≈øuch as are purely Archdeacons, and not Vicars to boote; And yet by the Note of Ma≈øter <hi>Lovells</hi> at the end of the new Divi≈øion, me thinkes there was an intention to have only 22.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:155571:13"/>the de≈øire of filling the Chapter proceed out of a feare that there will want a competent number of Chapter-men to make this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, con≈øidering the late Addition of Canons to the Chapter with power of voting in all affaires of the Clergy, there will be no want of almo≈øt as full a number as ever were of the Chapter ≈øince it was fir≈øt erected.</p>
               <p>For you ≈øee there never were above two or three and twenty at mo≈øt of the Chapter, and albeit mo≈øt of them that were Vicars and Archdeacons be dead; neverthele≈ø≈øe tho≈øe that are living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Canons lately added thereunto, amount to the number of twentie, as I wrote you word la≈øt weeke; onely I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got then to tell you, that one of the ≈øix whom I reckoned upon to be in <hi>Paris, viz.</hi> Ma≈øter <hi>Laborne,</hi> is neither of the Chapter in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Vicar, Archdeacon, or Canon, that I can find upon any Record, but this I impute to an Accident of his being out of the way at <hi>Tame</hi> when the Canons were made, and ≈øo I reckon upon him as if he were a Chapter-man, the rather becau≈øe he was, and is ≈øtill one of his Lord≈øhips Con≈øult, which may perhaps <hi>ip≈øo facto,</hi> give him that quality,<note place="margin">The whole Chapter in the nature of a Coun≈øell to Doctor <hi>Rich.

               <p>I≈øend you now according to my promi≈øe la≈øt week ≈øuch Copies of Patents as you de≈øired of Canons; and ≈øuch other of Vicars and Archdeacons, and Rurall Deanes as you may have need of for compleating the Chapter with ≈øuch light into that affaire as in the≈øe darke and confu≈øed times I could procure.</p>
               <p>I mu≈øt not omit to certifie your Lord≈øhip, that I have in≈øerted Mr. <hi>Peter Warnefords</hi> name among≈øt tho≈øe who are ≈øugge≈øted here to be made Canons, and I ≈øhould humbly de≈øire he may be made ≈øuch for one maine rea≈øon above others, that I have a probable hope hereby to ≈øecure the Chapter of the holy Thorne after his decea≈øe: and that is a Jewell which I am ≈øure your Lord≈øhip values at a high rate,<note place="margin">A pretious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</note> as al≈øo doe all others that know thereof.</p>
               <p>If the light I have given in the choice of ≈øuch men as may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Chapter be ≈øufficient to ≈øatisfy your Lord≈øhip of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the men ≈øugge≈øted: Perhaps it may not be a mi≈ø≈øe to thinke of even in the≈øe uncertaine times, if for no other rea≈øon then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent mortality, and that the Chapter might have the fuller power in its compleatne≈ø≈øe in ca≈øe your Lord≈øhip ≈øhould dy; as we that are many yeares younger cannot ≈øay but wee may dye very ≈øuddenly, and truly but for this only rea≈øon perhaps it were better deferre the filling up the Chapter till wee better times expected; yet ≈øince I writ tho≈øe inclo≈øed Papers I have refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that perhaps it may not bee ami≈ø≈øe to compleat the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with all ≈øpeed that may be, for however we cannot ≈øugge≈øt unto your Lord≈øhip all our men in every County, yet I am confident we have named tho≈øe that are fitte≈øt for ≈øuch places in each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ≈øuch as are per≈øoually be≈øt known I beleive to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip for the mo≈øt part of them.</p>

               <p>VVE have thought fit to acquaint you with ≈øome Informations that we have lately received, concerning the affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ≈øuch as we ≈øuppo≈øe you will think fit to be imparted to the Hou≈øe. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the <hi>Lath</hi> of Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> in the county of <hi>Kent,</hi> out of their charitable commi≈øeration of the mi≈øeries of the Prote≈øtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (being inabled thereunto by an Ordinance of Parliament). did in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large manner contribute and gather Five hundred quartets of Wheat, and other Grain; and accordingly ≈øent it over to <hi>Cork,</hi> imbarqued in a Ve≈ø≈øell called the <hi>Pro≈øperous</hi> of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> whereof one <hi>Thomas Ba≈ø≈øet</hi> was Ma≈øter; who accordingly carried the ≈øame unto <hi>Cork,</hi> and delivered it unto the hands of the Lord <hi>Inche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine,</hi> according to an Order of the Committee for Iri≈øh affairs: Now the ≈øaid Ve≈ø≈øell being returned, the Ma≈øter thereof makes this report, which we with all care and diligence have ≈øent up.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Fir≈øt, That the Lord <hi>Inchequine</hi> was ≈øo far from di≈øtributing the ≈øaid Grain, according to the intention of the Parliament, and the Doners, (who did intend it as a free Gift, for the relief of the poor Prote≈øtants in <hi>Ireland</hi>) that he did ≈øeize it, and ≈øell it at a very dear rate, to any that would buy it, detaining it from tho≈øe to whom it was given.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:155571:18"/>
               <p n="2">2. That he did not onely deprive them of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Charity, but al≈øo oppre≈øt them, with Billetting of two Regiments of Souldiers, that are ≈øince ≈øent over, (whereof the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Ba≈ø≈øet</hi> was an eye-witne≈ø≈øe) under the command of Sir <hi>Charles Vava≈øour,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Pawlet,</hi> to the Port of <hi>Bri≈øtoll,</hi> to ≈øerve here again≈øt the Parliament.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Lord <hi>Inchequine</hi> did pre≈ø≈øe the ≈øaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, <hi>Thomas Ba≈ø≈øet,</hi> to carry over more Souldiers to the Port of <hi>Bri≈øtoll,</hi> which <hi>Ba≈ø≈øet</hi> did colourably undertake, and attended ≈øeverall dayes to receive the Souldiers aboard of him, till ≈øuch time as he met with a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient opportunity to make his e≈øcape, which he de≈øired, and now at la≈øt obtained.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ≈øaid <hi>Thomas Ba≈ø≈øet</hi> doth report upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good grounds, That there are further intentions of rai≈øing great Forces of the Iri≈øh Rebells, to come over to ≈øerve again≈øt the Parliament; and that for pre≈øent there are ready two Regiments, under the command of Sir <hi>Hardes Waller,</hi> and four Regiments of the Lord <hi>Inchequines,</hi> and ≈øix Troops of Hor≈øe under the command of the Earl of <hi>Cork;</hi> all which are to be li≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to maintain this unnaturall War again≈øt the Parliament and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Now that it may appear that this Information of <hi>Thomas Ba≈ø≈øet</hi> is not conjecturall, he is ready to te≈øtific all this upon Oath; And for pre≈øent we have here ≈øent up divers In≈øtruments tending to this effect, ≈øub≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Lord <hi>Inchiquine,</hi> and delivered to the ≈øaid <hi>Thomas Ba≈ø≈øet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all this you may perceive what a De≈øigne there is to bring over both Hor≈øe and Foot of the Iri≈øh, to war here again≈øt the Parliament; which might in ≈øome
